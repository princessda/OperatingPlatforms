Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
To summarise The client, The Gaming Room, is a game development company specializing in casual and party games. They requested the design of a multiplayer, interactive software application for their game, Draw It Or Lose It. The game is centered around players drawing prompts while others guess what the drawings represent, with a focus on fun and engaging gameplay that can be easily enjoyed by people of all ages. They required a user-friendly interface, online multiplayer support, and the ability to accommodate a variety of players in real-time.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I believe the strongest aspect of the documentation was the clear and organized breakdown of both the functional and non-functional requirements. By outlining detailed user stories, expected gameplay flow, and technical specifications (like server requirements and UI design), I ensured that the development process could proceed smoothly without confusion. The inclusion of visual aids, such as wireframes and flowcharts, also helped communicate the design more effectively.



What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The design document served as a clear reference point throughout the development process, ensuring that I stayed aligned with the client’s vision. It helped identify potential issues early, such as server performance concerns for handling multiplayer connections and the structure of real-time interactions. Working through the document allowed me to break down the project into manageable modules and prioritize features, which made coding more structured and efficient.




If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
One area I would revise is the section detailing error handling and edge cases. Initially, the documentation was too focused on ideal scenarios and didn’t fully account for potential server downtimes, lag issues, or player disconnections. To improve this, I would include more robust strategies for handling these edge cases, such as automatic reconnection procedures, visual feedback during lag, and more detailed testing protocols to ensure a smoother user experience even in less-than-ideal conditions.


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the users’ needs by analyzing the target audience: casual gamers who want a fun, accessible, and social experience. The software was designed with a straightforward interface, minimal setup requirements, and an intuitive drawing system. It’s essential to consider users’ needs because the ultimate goal is to create a product that is enjoyable and usable, which in turn drives user retention and engagement. If the design fails to meet these needs, it risks losing users quickly


How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I adopted an iterative design process, starting with wireframes and basic prototypes to visualize core gameplay mechanics and user flows. After gathering feedback, I refined the design and moved to high-fidelity prototypes. In the future, I would continue using an iterative approach but would also employ user testing earlier in the design phase to catch potential usability issues sooner. Additionally, I would consider incorporating agile principles, breaking the design and development into smaller sprints to adapt quickly to any new user feedback or changes in requirements
